    <h1>Census 2021 in Sussex</h1>
    <p>The census is a national survey which happens once every 10 years across England and Wales providing a detailed snapshot of factors releting to people, their households, and their homes. Responses help organisations to make decisions on planning and funding public services in local areas, including transport, education, and healthcare.</p>
    <p>Census Day 2021 was on Sunday 21 March 2021.</p>
    <p>This analyses shows an overview summary of what the 2021 Census can tell us about the population of Sussex, with a particular emphasis on creating tools for use in Public Health.</p>

    <p>It is split into four sections. This page shows a brief population overview and structure (age and sex) of each area. A <a href="./health.html">Health</a> page shows the self-reported health status, disability and provision of unpaid care across Sussex. <a href="./wider_determinants.html">wider determinants</a> page shows analyses of characteristics of the population such as ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity as well as education, housing, and labour market which can influence health of a population. Finally, a <a href="./boundary_change.html">changes in boundaries</a> page showing how neighbourhood boundaries have been redefined as a result of the changing development in Sussex.</p>

    <section id = 'population_overview'>
    <h1>Population overview</h1>    

    <p>The table below shows the overall population estimates as at Census day 2021 for each of our lower and upper tier local authorites. More information about the age and sex structure is available in the section below.</p>
  

    <h3>Table - Overall population estimates (usual residents) by area; Census 2021</h3>
    <table id = 'table_1' style="margin-bottom: 20px" class = 'table_1_class'>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th style = 'text-align: left;'>Local authority</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Total</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Females</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Males</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Median age<br>(persons)</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
   <tbody id="table_total_1"></tbody>
   </table>
   <p>The median age of the population in Brighton and Hove (38 years) is a decade younger than East Sussex (48 years), with West Sussex roughly in between the two.</p>
   <p>There is also substantial variation within the local authorities, ranging from 37 years in Crawley, to 53 years in Rother. The median age in all areas rose by roughly 2-3 years since the 2011 Census.</p>
   <p>The next table shows the overall population change between the 2011 and 2021 censuses for Sussex areas. All areas increased in population (usual residents) size, although some areas increased more than others particularly in West Sussex. Arun, Crawley, and Horsham all had at least 10% more usual residents in the 2021 Census.</p>
   
   <h3>Table - Overall population (usual residents) change by area; Census 2011 compared to 2021</h3>
   <table id = 'table_2' style="margin-bottom: 20px" class = 'table_1_class'>

      <tr>
        <th style = 'text-align: left;'>Local authority</th>
        <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Census<br>2011</th>
        <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Census<br>2021</th>

  </table>

   <h3>Census 2021 population structure</h3>
   <p>Different parts of Sussex have markedly different populations. For example, Brighton and Hove has a much younger population compared to Rother.</p>
   <p>Use the drop down menu here to choose a area to find out more information about its age and sex population structure.</p>
    
   <h4 id = 'selected_area_pyramid_title'></h4>
   <select title = 'Population pyramid area selector' id="select_area_pyramid_button"></select>

   <div id = 'pyramid_container'>
   <div id = 'pyramid_census_datavis'></div>
   <div>
   <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_1'></p>
   <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_2'></p>
   <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_3'></p>
   <p>The shape of the pyramid gives an indication of the age structure of a population, if the shape is wider at the top, this is indicative of an ageing population and a pyramid which is wider at the bottom indicates a relatively younger population overall.</p>
   <p class = 'good_to_know'>Note that the x axis scale (along the bottom) is redrawn when a new area is selected.</p>

    <h1>Small area population estimates</h1>    

    <p>Overall population estimates are available at very local areas down to neighbourhoods. For more detail on small area geographies, see the <a href = './boundary_change.html'>changes in boundaries</a> section.</p>

    <p>The map below shows the overall population available at Lower layer super output areas (LSOAs), Middle layer super output areas (MSOA), and local authority (LTLA) level. Click on an area to find out the population size and you can toggle between each area type using the buttons on the top right of the map.</p>
    <p>The map is coloured by the population density of each area; this is the number of people resident in an area per square kilometre. Differences in population density become much more apparent at smaller geographies like LSOAs and MSOAs.</p>

    <h3>Map - small area population estimates; Census 2021</h3>
    <div id = "map_overall_population"></div>
    
    <p>You can also search for a postcode in the box below for any postcode in Sussex to zoom into that local area. </p>
    
    <div class="inputHolder">
     <input placeholder="Postcode" type="text" id="txtPostcode" />
     <input type="button" value="Search" id="btnPostcode" />

     <h4 id="local_postcode_summary_1"></h4>
     <p id="local_postcode_summary_2"></p>
   </div>
 
 
    <p>Note that population estimates for particular demographics (such as by age) are not currently available for every geography whilst the ONS prioritises releasing topic summary data as fast as possible. These data will become available soon.</p>
    <p>For now, the smallest geography available for looking at differences by age is at MSOA level.</p>
