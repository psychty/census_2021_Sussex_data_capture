    <h1>Census 2021 in Sussex</h1>
    <p>The census is a national survey which happens once every 10 years across England and Wales providing a detailed snapshot of factors releting to people, their households, and their homes. Responses help organisations to make decisions on planning and funding public services in local areas, including transport, education, and healthcare.</p>
    <p>Census Day 2021 was on Sunday 21 March 2021.</p>
    <p>This analyses shows an overview summary of what the 2021 Census can tell us about the population of Sussex, with a particular emphasis on creating tools for use in Public Health.</p>

    <p>It is split into four sections. This page shows a brief population overview and structure (age and sex) of each area. A <a href="./health.html">Health</a> page shows the self-reported health status, disability and provision of unpaid care across Sussex. <a href="./wider_determinants.html">wider determinants</a> page shows analyses of characteristics of the population such as ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity as well as education, housing, and labour market which can influence health of a population. Finally, a <a href="./boundary_change.html">changes in boundaries</a> page showing how neighbourhood boundaries have been redefined as a result of the changing development in Sussex.</p>

    <h1>Population overview</h1>    

    <h3>Table - Overall population estimates (usual residents) by area; Census 2021</h3>
    <table id = 'table_1' style="margin-bottom: 20px" class = 'table_1_class'>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th style = 'text-align: left;'>Local authority</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Total</th>
         <th style = 'text-align: right;'>Females</th>

       </tr>
     </thead>
   <tbody id="table_total_1"></tbody>
   </table>

    <h3>Population structure</h3>
    <p>Different parts of Sussex have markedly different populations. For example, Brighton and Hove has a much younger population compared to Horsham.</p>

    <p>Use the drop down menu here to choose a area to find out more information about its age and sex population structure.</p>
    
    <h4 id = 'selected_area_pyramid_title'></h4>
    <select title = 'Population pyramid area selector' id="select_area_pyramid_button"></select>
    <h4 class = 'title'>NOTE: this population pyramid is not currently displaying as it should, please do not use.</h4>
    <div id = 'pyramid_container'>

    <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_1'></p>
    <!-- <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_2'></p> -->
    <!-- <p id = 'area_age_structure_text_3'></p> -->
    <p>The shape of the pyramid gives an indication of the age structure of a population, if the shape is wider at the top, this is indicative of an ageing population and a pyramid which is wider at the bottom indicates a relatively younger population overall.</p>
    <p class = 'good_to_know'>Note that the x axis scale (along the bottom) is redrawn when a new area is selected.</p>
