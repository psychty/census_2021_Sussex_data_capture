# Census 2021 Sussex data capture

This repo is for sharing tools, mostly in R, to help collate, analyse, and visualise Census 2021 data as it becomes available.

There are a few ways to extract the data;

| Extraction method                                                                 | Script name             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| downloading all available data for an area type to a local directory              | Local_data_extraction.R |
| using the nomisr package to read data as you need it for the area you need it for | NomisR_data_exraction.R |

I want this to be an inclusive, collaborative repo with contributors across our teams.

To start this, we have added a few scripts for creating maps and population pyramids.

#TODO We may need to work on making file paths relative to everyones work set up.
