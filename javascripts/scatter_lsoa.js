// TODO
// If we can get the joins working, i would like to be able to join the demographic objects (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity) to things like our disability tables.
// This would need to be a wide format table i think.

// I have scatter plots elsewhere (maybe the lsoa mortality one or the vaccine scripts).
