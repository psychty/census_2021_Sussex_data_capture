        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>This page is not currently accessibility friendly, due to some of the interactive elements on some figures and the maps.

        <h1>Primary Care Network view in Sussex</h1>
        <p>This page shows much of the data on the other pages but enables a quick glance view for understanding local Census data for Primary Care Networks (PCN) footprints.</p>

        <div class="good_to_know">
            <h3>What is a PCN</h3>
            <p>PCNs are networks of general practices which attempt to integrate primary care with secondary and community services, and bridge a gap between general practice and emerging Integrated Care Systems (Fisher, Thorlby, & Alderwick, 2019). Each PCN is made up a group of a number of GP practices forming a network that covers approximately 30,000 to 50,000 patients.</p>
            <p id = pcn_summary_text_1></p>
            <p id = pcn_summary_text_2></p>
            </div>

<p>The first map shows publicly available data on the residential neighbourhoods where patients registered to a particular PCN live according to their GP record.</p>
<p>We have excluded LSOAs where less than five residents are registered to the PCN. The GP practices linked to this PCN are also included on the map.</p>
<p>Choose a PCN by name: </p>
<select  title = 'PCN area selector' id="select_pcn_1_button"></select>
<h4 id="pcn_reach_title_1"></h4>
<div id = map_pcn_reach_lsoa></div>

            <!-- <p>Each PCN boundary is made by aggregating Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) together. However, it should be noted that GP practices do not have geographical boundaries and more than one GP practice can operate in the same local area. Whilst the map is useful to understand roughly the local areas that each PCN may cover, for planning purposes, in reality these boundaries are not mutually exclusive (e.g. there is some crossover as patients may use GP services outside of their local areas).</p> -->
            <!-- <p>We have assigned every LSOA in West Sussex to one PCN based on data from the number of residents in the LSOA registered to each GP practice and some GP practices operate in areas assigned to other PCNs (e.g. Horsham Collaborative practices in Horsham Central areas). PCN boundaries can transcend district and borough boundaries and some even cross into neighbouring counties.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Each GP practice in West Sussex is shown as a dot which is also coloured by the PCN (see the key under the map). Click on one of these dots to see more. Note that GP practices often have patients on their lists who may travel far, even out of the district or county, to use their services. Some practices may be part of one PCN but physically located inside an area designated to a different PCN.</p> -->
