        <!-- <p>This page is not currently accessibility friendly, due to some of the interactive elements on some figures and the maps.

        <p>This page displays a lot of data and may take a few moments to load.</p>
        <p>As at January 2023, the numbers of patients in each LSOA registered to GP practices data in the public domain is only available for 2011 LSOA boundaries. In time these should be updated to 2021 LSOA boundaries, but for the moment there may be some descrepancies at the fringes of boundaries/footprints as patients might be assigned to new (split or merged) LSOAs. See the <a href = './boundary_change.html'>changes in boundaries</a> page for more information.</p>

        <h1>Primary Care Network Footprints in Sussex</h1>
        <!-- <p>This page shows much of the data on the other pages but enables a quick glance view for understanding local Census data for Primary Care Networks (PCN) footprints.</p> -->
        <p>This page shows the extent to which Primary Care Networks (PCNs) serve geographical catchments of populations. There are no officially defined boundaries for PCNs and so on this page we demonstrate some of the methods available to define a Sussex PCN footprint which can be used elsewhere on the website to get Census 2021 data relevant to the populations served by each PCN.</p>
        <p>Each PCN footprint is made by aggregating Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) together. However, it should be noted that GP practices do not have geographical boundaries and more than one GP practice can operate in the same local area. Whilst footprint map is useful to understand roughly the local areas that each PCN may cover, for planning purposes, in reality these boundaries are not mutually exclusive (e.g. there is some crossover as patients may use GP services outside of their local areas).</p>
        <p>As such, in the first map below we show the breadth of reach for each PCN across Sussex (and beyond in some cases). In the second map, we assign neighbourhoods to a single PCN to create footprints, which can be useful for planning purposes. It is this mutually exclusive footprint map that is used in the final section of this page to draw together relevant Census 2021 data.</p>

        <div class="good_to_know">
            <h3>What is a PCN?</h3>
            <p>PCNs are networks of general practices which attempt to integrate primary care with secondary and community services, and bridge a gap between general practice and emerging Integrated Care Systems (Fisher, Thorlby, & Alderwick, 2019). Each PCN is made up a group of a number of GP practices forming a network that covers approximately 30,000 to 50,000 patients.</p>
            <p id = pcn_summary_text_1></p>
            <p id = pcn_summary_text_2></p>
            <p>The Sussex PCNs form part of the wider NHS Sussex Integrated Care System (ICS) and Integrated Care Board (ICB) which is statutory body responsible for planning and funding most NHS services in the area. See the <a href= 'https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/integrated-care-systems-explained'>Kings Fund</a> for an explainer on Integrated Care Systems in England.</p>
            </div>

<p id = pcn_summary_text_3></p>
<p>The first map shows publicly available data on the residential neighbourhoods where patients registered to a particular PCN (as well as those NHS Sussex ICB practices that were not recorded by NHS Digital as being allocated to a PCN) live according to their GP record. We have excluded LSOAs where less than five residents are registered to the PCN. The GP practices linked to this PCN are also included on the map.</p>
<p id = pcn_summary_text_4></p>

<p>Change the PCN using the drop down menu below. You can also toggle the Local Authority boundaries on and off using the check box in the top right corner of the map.</p>
<select  title = 'PCN area selector' id="select_pcn_x_button"></select>
<h4 id="pcn_reach_title_1"></h4>
<div id = map_pcn_reach_lsoa></div>
<p>For many PCNs, such as Dean's and Central Brighton PCN, the neighbourhoods closest to the practices have the most patients. However, for others, such as Healthy Crawley PCN and Hastings & St Leonards PCN, where some of the neighbourhoods with the largest numbers of registered patients are further away from the GP practice main sites. <b>Note: some practices may have branch surgeries which are not included on these maps (which shows the main site of a practice only)</b>. Nonetheless, it shows the importance of considering the geographic spread of registered patients when commissioning and monitoring community based services.</p>
<p>You can also see from the map that PCN reach transcends what might be considered natural boundaries for local communities, outside of the district and boroughs of the practices as well as outside of the counties and into neighbouring Surrey and Kent. An example of this is Crawley Care Collaborative PCN which has a registered populaiton of more than 1,000 patients in neighbouring Chichester district, and Rural Rother PCN which has hundreds of registered patients in neighbourhoods in Kent.</p>

<h1>Neighbourhood view - PCN footprints</h1>
<p>There are a few methods of assigning neighbourhoods to PCNs which we outline here.</p>
<p>The first method (Method 1 - all PCNs) shows a PCN footprint if the LSOA is assigned to the PCN of which most residents are registered using all PCNs in England. This means that some areas (such as neighbourhoods in the north of Chichester around Rogate, and Fernhurst) on the fringes/outskirts of Sussex (within the Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, and West Sussex local authority boundaries) might be assigned to a PCN from a different ICB (such as NHS Surrey Heartlands ICB or NHS Hampshire and Isle Of Wight ICB).</p> 
  
<p>The second method (Method 2 - Sussex PCNs) assigns LSOAs to the Sussex PCN of which most residents are registered. This makes sure that every LSOA in the Sussex local authority boundaries are assigned to a Sussex PCN. However, this method excludes neighbourhoods outside of the local authority footprint which may be assigned to a Sussex PCN based on the first method such as in the north of Felbridge in East Gristead.</p>

<p>The next map shows Sussex neighbourhoods assigned to a single PCN using Method 1 - all England PCNs and Method 2 - Sussex PCNs. Remember, these are mutually exclusive boundaries that do not consider the complete breadth of a PCNs reach (as in map one above). Here, each neighbourhood is assigned to the PCN from which the highest number of patients are registered.</p>
<p>For each method you can choose if they are coloured by PCN (enabling you to distinguish neighbouring footprints) as well as looking at the footprint population coverage. The footprint population coverage is the proportion of patients registered to the PCN that are covered by the allocated footprint. Those with lighter colours capture upwards of 95% of the registered population whilst the very dark coloured footprints capture less that 60% of the registered population. This is an important value to consider as not all allocated footprints cover the same proportion of a PCNs population.</p>

<h4>Sussex LSOAs mapped to PCNs - PCN footprint</h4>
<div id = map_lsoa_pcn_footprint></div>

<!-- <p>We have assigned every LSOA in West Sussex to one PCN based on data from the number of residents in the LSOA registered to each GP practice and some GP practices operate in areas assigned to other PCNs (e.g. Horsham Collaborative practices in Horsham Central areas). PCN boundaries can transcend district and borough boundaries and some even cross into neighbouring counties.</p> -->
