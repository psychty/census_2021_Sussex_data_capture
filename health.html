        <h1>Health in Sussex</h1>
        <p>The 2021 Census asked people to self-report their general health status from very poor, to very good health, as well as asking people if they were disabled (as defined under the Equality Act) and whether they provided unpaid care to another person. These responses are detailed on this page.</p>
        <p>We show small area (LSOA) differences in some of the responses to these Census questions and where possible aggregate or combine the data at small area to the level of PCN based on our PCN footprints (see the <a href = './pcn.html'>PCN footprint page</a> for more details).</p>
        
        <div class="good_to_know">
        <h3>A note about age and health</h3>
        <p>Health (or ill health in particular) is closely related to age with peoples health tending to decline as people get older and the need for care to increase. As such, you might expect areas with higher proportions of older people to have worse health outcomes. To account for this, the ONS have created age-standardised data but this is not available at small area (LSOA) level detailed here.</p>

        <p>At the bottom of this page you can find an interactive scatter plot to compare the relationship between indicators at area level.</p>

      <section id = 'general_health'>
        <h2>General Health</h2>
        <p>The first map below shows the proportion of residents in each small area neighbourhood that self-report their health as being eiher good or very good. You can also switch the map to show the proportion who reported their health as bad or very bad by clicking the radio buttons on the top right of the map. Finally, you can toggle on overlay boundaries for Local Authorities and for the PCN footprints as defined by our method 2 analysis (detailed on the <a href = './pcn.html'>PCN footprint page</a>).</p>
        
        <h3>Map - small area population estimates; Census 2021</h3>
        <div id = "map_general_health_id"></div>
        <p>The map highlights the variation across Sussex, with northern areas of the map tending to report higher proportions of good health than areas across the coast. Residents in the Horsham LSOA (E01035339, near Wickhurst Green) reported the highest proportion with 94% of its residents reporting good or very good health. In contrast, the Brighton and Hove LSOA (E01016942, near Kemptown) had the smallest proportion of residents (just 60%) reporting good or very good health. This Brighton and Hove LSOA also has the highest proportion of residents reporting worse general health with one in five residents (19%) reporting their health as bad or very bad. Overall, Brighton and Hove has a lot of variation in a fairly small geographical area with some of the highest and lowest proportions of good or very good health in neighbourhoods just streets apart.</p>

        <p>The table below shows the self-reported general health responses by small areas aggregated up to the PCN footprint. This helps to give a guide for the populations covered by the network for planning purposes but remember, this is the area designated as covering the majority of patients registered to the PCN. It is not the PCN registered population itself. Some residents the areas in a PCNs footprint may be registered to other PCNs and some registered patients may live outside of the areas designated in the footprint of a particular PCN.</p>
        <p>The number of residents reporting each response is given in brackets next to the proportion of residents in that area.</p>

      <section id = 'disability'>
        <h2>Disability</h2>
        <p>A person is defined as disabled if they assessed their day-to-day activities as limited by long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses. This definition of a disabled person meets the harmonised standard for measuring disability and is in line with the Equality Act (2010).</p>
        <p>The 2021 Census also enables us to count how many households in an area have one or more people who are registered disabled under the Equality Act.</p>

      <section id = 'unpaid_care'>
        <h2>Unpaid care</h2>
        <p>This Census 2021 question asks "Do you look after, or give any help or support to, anyone because they have long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses, or problems related to old age?". People were asked to exclude anything they did as part of their paid employment. The wording of the question differs from the 2011 Census question, which began "Do you look after, or give any help or support to family members, friends, neighbours or others".</p>
        <p>The responses to this question are a good proxy measure of the need for care, and need for support for carers in an area, although this indicator doesn't explicitly tell us the number of people in need of care.</p>
