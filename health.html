        <h1>Health in Sussex</h1>
        <p>The 2021 Census asked people to self-report their general health status from very poor, to very good health, as well as asking people if they were disabled (as defined under the Equality Act) and whether they provided unpaid care to another person. These responses are detailed on this page.</p>
        <p>We show small area (LSOA) differences in some of the responses to these Census questions and where possible aggregate or combine the data at small area to the level of PCN based on our PCN footprints (see the <a href = './pcn.html'>PCN footprint page</a> for more details) and Local Authorities.</p>
   <!-- <p>At the bottom of this page you can find an interactive scatter plot to compare the relationship between indicators at area level.</p> -->

      </section>
    
      <section id = 'general_health'>
        <h2>General Health</h2>
        <p>In England overall, roughly four out of five people (82.2%) report their health as good or very good, about 13% report fair health and around 5% of the population report bad or very bad health. This is broadly similar to the picture locally although there is some variation.</p>
        <p>The table below shows the self-reported general health responses by upper and lower tier local authorities in Sussex as well as the South east region and England. </p>
        <h3>Table -  Overall population (usual residents) self-reported general health; Sussex local authority areas; Census 2021</h3>

        <tbody id="table_higher_health_1_body"></tbody>
        </table>
  <p>The proportion of residents reporting their health as bad or very bad is highest in East Sussex (5.7%) and lowest in West Sussex (4.5%) with all three Sussex authorities having a higher proportion of residents reporting bad health compared to the South East region. Within Sussex, this ranges from 3.5% in Horsham and Mid Sussex to 7.3% of residents in Hastings.</p>

  <div class="good_to_know">
  <h3>A note about age and health</h3>
  <p>Health (or ill health in particular) is closely related to age with peoples health tending to decline as people get older and the need for care to increase. As such, you might expect areas with higher proportions of older people to have worse health outcomes. To account for this, the ONS have created age-standardised proportions for higher geography areas.</p>

  </div>
    <p>The table below shows that when adjusted for the age profile of each area, Brighton and Hove now has the highest proportion of residents reporting bad or very bad health.</p>
    <h3>Table - Age standardised proportions of self-reported general health; Sussex local authority areas; Census 2021</h3>

      </thead>
    <tbody id="table_higher_health_2_body"></tbody>
    </table>

  <p>However, age standardised data is not available at small area (LSOA) and as such it is important to consider this when interpreting the small area and PCN data (which is aggregated using small area data) as it does not account for the differences in age structures in each area/population.</p>
</div>
        <p>The map below shows the proportion of residents in each small area neighbourhood that self-report their health as being eiher good or very good (unadjusted counts). You can also switch the map to show the proportion who reported their health as bad or very bad by clicking the radio buttons on the top right of the map. Finally, you can toggle on overlay boundaries for Local Authorities and for the PCN footprints as defined by our method 2 analysis (detailed on the <a href = './pcn.html'>PCN footprint page</a>).</p>
        
        <h3>Map - small area self-reported general health; Census 2021</h3>
        <div id = "map_general_health_id"></div>
        <p>The map highlights the variation across Sussex, with northern areas of the map tending to report higher proportions of good health than areas across the coast. Residents in the Horsham LSOA (E01035339, near Wickhurst Green) reported the highest proportion with 94% of its residents reporting good or very good health. In contrast, the Brighton and Hove LSOA (E01016942, near Kemptown) had the smallest proportion of residents (just 60%) reporting good or very good health. This Brighton and Hove LSOA also has the highest proportion of residents reporting worse general health with one in five residents (19%) reporting their health as bad or very bad. Overall, Brighton and Hove has a lot of variation in a fairly small geographical area with some of the highest and lowest proportions of good or very good health in neighbourhoods just streets apart.</p>

        <p>The table below shows the self-reported general health responses by small areas aggregated up to the PCN footprint. This helps to give a guide for the populations covered by the network for planning purposes but remember, this is the area designated as covering the majority of patients registered to the PCN. It is not the PCN registered population itself. Some residents the areas in a PCNs footprint may be registered to other PCNs and some registered patients may live outside of the areas designated in the footprint of a particular PCN.</p>
        <p>The number of residents reporting each response is given in brackets next to the proportion of residents in that area.</p>

        <h2>Disability</h2>
        <p>A person is defined as disabled if they assessed their day-to-day activities as limited by long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses. This definition of a disabled person meets the harmonised standard for measuring disability and is in line with the Equality Act (2010).</p>
        <p>The 2021 Census also enables us to count how many households in an area have one or more people who are registered disabled under the Equality Act.</p>

<p>Around one in ten residents say they have a disability which limits their day-to-day activities a little, with slightly higher proportions in Brighton and Hove and East Sussex compared to West Sussex.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number and proportion of residents reporting disability (activities limited a little or a lot as well as overall numbers of people reporting any disability) in Sussex local authority areas and in the South East region and England overall.</p>
<p>The number of residents reporting each response is given in brackets next to the proportion of residents in that area. West Sussex and its district and boroughs tend to have the lowest proportion of residents reporting any disability out of the Sussex areas. In East Sussex one in five residents reported being disabled in the 2021 Census.</p> 
<p>Within the counties, Hastings, Eastbourne, Arun, Adur, and Worthing have the highest proportions of residents reporting a disability, whilst Horsham and Mid Sussex have the lowest prevalence. </p>

    <p>The second disability table shows that when the proportion of people reporting a disability is age-standardised. This takes into account the different age profile of each area. West Sussex still has the lowest proportion of residents reporting day-to-day activities limited a little or a lot, but Brighton and Hove now has the highest proportion of those reporting disability.</p>

        <p>There is also a coastal and inland divide across Sussex, with northern areas of the map tending to have a smaller proportion of residents and households with disability. More than a third of residents in the Brighton LSOA (E01016942) reported having a disability as defined by the Equality Act (2010). In contrast, the Chichester LSOA E01031532 had the lowest propoeriotn at 7%. There are however neighbourhoods in Crawley which have a higher proportion of disabled residents as well as households with at least one person whose day-to-day activities are limited by long-term physical or mental health conditions.</p>

        <p>The table below shows the proportion of residents and households with residents who have a disability by small areas aggregated up to the PCN footprint. This helps to give a guide for the populations covered by the network for planning purposes but remember, this is the area designated as covering the majority of patients registered to the PCN.

      <h2>Disability by age and sex</h2>
      <p>As with general health, disability changes with age as well as by sex. Breaking disability prevalence down by sex and age generally shows a steady increase in the proportion of people who were disabled from aged 30 onwards, in both sexes. Steeper increases are seen in age groups above 65-74 years.</p>

      <p>The figure below shows the age-specific prevalence of any disability (regardless of whether it limits day-to-day activities a little or alot). Use the drop down menu here to choose a area to find out more information about its age and sex population structure. The dashed line represents England and so when the coloured bars for an age group (for example in the 15-24 years and 25-34 years group in Brighton and Hove) extend beyond the dashed lines we can see that there is a greater age-specific prevalence of disability compared to national prevalence.</p>
      <p>Equally, when the bars fall short of the dashed lines (as in Chichester for groups over 35 years), then we can see the age-specific prevalence is lower than England.</p>

        <p>This Census 2021 question asks "Do you look after, or give any help or support to, anyone because they have long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses, or problems related to old age?". People were asked to exclude anything they did as part of their paid employment. The wording of the question differs from the 2011 Census question, which began "Do you look after, or give any help or support to family members, friends, neighbours or others".</p>
        <p>The responses to this question are a good proxy measure of the need for care, and need for support for carers in an area, although this indicator doesn't explicitly tell us the number of people in need of care.</p>
